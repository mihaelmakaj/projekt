        <h3>You Belong with Me</h3>
        <pre class="lyrics">
            You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
            She's going off about something that you said
            'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
            I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
            I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
            And she'll never know your story like I do
            But she wears short skirts
            I wear T-shirts
            She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
            Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
            That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
            If you could see that I'm the one
            Who understands you
            Been here all along
            So, why can't you see?
            You belong with me
            You belong with me
            Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
            I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
            Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
            Hey, isn't this easy?
            And you've got a smile
            That can light up this whole town
            I haven't seen it in a while
            Since she brought you down
            You say you're fine, I know you better than that
            Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?
            She wears high heels
            I wear sneakers
            She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
            Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
            That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
            If you could see that I'm the one
            Who understands you
            Been here all along
            So, why can't you see?
            You belong with me
            Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
            All this time how could you not know, baby?
            You belong with me
            You belong with me
            Oh, I remember you driving to my house
            In the middle of the night
            I'm the one who makes you laugh
            When you know you're 'bout to cry
            And I know your favorite songs
            And you tell me 'bout your dreams
            Think I know where you belong
            Think I know it's with me
            Can't you see that I'm the one
            Who understands you?
            Been here all along
            So, why can't you see?
            You belong with me
            Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
            All this time how could you not know, baby?
            You belong with me
            You belong with me
            You belong with me
            Have you ever thought just maybe
            You belong with me?
            You belong with me

        <h3>I Knew You Were Trouble</h3>
        <pre class="lyrics">
            Once upon a time
            A few mistakes ago
            I was in your sights
            You got me alone
            You found me
            You found me
            You found me
            I guess you didn't care
            And I guess I liked that
            And when I fell hard
            You took a step back
            Without me
            Without me
            Without me
            And he's long gone
            When he's next to me
            And I realize
            The blame is on me
            'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
            So shame on me now
            Flew me to places I'd never been
            'Til you put me down, oh
            I knew you were trouble when you walked in
            So, shame on me now
            Flew me to places I'd never been
            Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
            Oh, oh
            Trouble, trouble, trouble
            Oh, oh
            Trouble, trouble, trouble
            No apologies
            He'll never see you cry
            Pretends he doesn't know
            That he's the reason why
            You're drowning
            You're drowning
            You're drowning
            And I heard you moved on
            From whispers on the street
            A new notch in your belt
            Is all I'll ever be
            And now I see
            Now I see
            Now I see
            He was long gone
            When he met me
            And I realize
            The joke is on me, hey
            I knew you were trouble when you walked in (oh)
            So shame on me now
            Flew me to places I'd never been
            'Til you put me down, oh
            I knew you were trouble when you walked in
            So shame on me now
            Flew me to places I'd never been, yeah
            Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
            Oh, oh (yeah)
            Trouble, trouble, trouble
            Oh, oh
            Trouble, trouble, trouble
            And the saddest fear
            Comes creepin' in
            That you never loved me
            Or her
            Or anyone
            Or anything
            Yeah
            I knew you were trouble when you walked in
            So shame on me now
            Flew me to places I'd never been (never been)
            'Til you put me down, oh
            I knew you were trouble when you walked in (knew it right there)
            So shame on me now (knew it right there)
            Flew me to places I'd never been
            (Ooh) now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
            Oh, oh
            Trouble, trouble, trouble (oh)
            Oh, oh
            Trouble, trouble, trouble
            I knew you were trouble when you walked in
            Trouble, trouble, trouble
            I knew you were trouble when you walked in
            Trouble, trouble, trouble

        <h3>Blank Space</h3>
        <pre class="lyrics">
            Nice to meet you, where you been?
            I could show you incredible things
            Magic, madness, heaven, sin
            Saw you there and I thought
            "Oh, my God, look at that face
            You look like my next mistake
            Love's a game, wanna play?" Ay
            New money, suit and tie
            I can read you like a magazine
            Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
            And I know you heard about me
            So hey, let's be friends
            I'm dying to see how this one ends
            Grab your passport and my hand
            I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
            So it's gonna be forever
            Or it's gonna go down in flames
            You can tell me when it's over, mm
            If the high was worth the pain
            Got a long list of ex-lovers
            They'll tell you I'm insane
            'Cause you know I love the players
            And you love the game
            'Cause we're young, and we're reckless
            We'll take this way too far
            It'll leave you breathless, mm
            Or with a nasty scar
            Got a long list of ex-lovers
            They'll tell you I'm insane
            But I've got a blank space, baby
            And I'll write your name
            Cherry lips, crystal skies
            I could show you incredible things
            Stolen kisses, pretty lies
            You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
            Find out what you want
            Be that girl for a month
            Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
            Screaming, crying, perfect storms
            I can make all the tables turn
            Rose garden filled with thorns
            Keep you second guessing like
            "Oh, my God, who is she?"
            I get drunk on jealousy
            But you'll come back each time you leave
            'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
            So it's gonna be forever
            Or it's gonna go down in flames

            'Cause we're young, and we're reckless
            We'll take this way too far (ooh)
            It'll leave you breathless, mm
            Or with a nasty scar (leave a nasty scar)
            Got a long list of ex-lovers
            They'll tell you I'm insane
            But I've got a blank space, baby
            And I'll write your name

        <h3>Love Story</h3>
        <pre class="lyrics">
            We were both young when I first saw you
            I close my eyes and the flashback starts
            I'm standin' there
            On a balcony in summer air
            See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
            See you make your way through the crowd
            And say, "Hello"
            Little did I know
            That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
            And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
            And I was cryin' on the staircase
            Beggin' you, "Please don't go, " and I said
            Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
            I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
            You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
            It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
            So I sneak out to the garden to see you
            We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
            So close your eyes
            Escape this town for a little while, oh oh
            'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
            And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
            But you were everything to me
            I was beggin' you, "Please don't go, " and I said
            Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
            I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
            You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
            It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
            Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
            This love is difficult, but it's real
            Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
            It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
            Oh, oh
            I got tired of waiting
            Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
            My faith in you was fading
            When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
            Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
            I keep waiting for you, but you never come
            Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
            He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
            And said, "Marry me, Juliet
            You'll never have to be alone
            I love you and that's all I really know
            I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
            It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
            Oh, oh, oh
            Oh, oh, oh, oh
            'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
