        <h3>You Belong with Me</h3>
        <pre class="lyrics">
            You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
            She's going off about something that you said
            'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
            I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
            I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
            And she'll never know your story like I do
            But she wears short skirts
            I wear T-shirts
            She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
            Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
            That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
            If you could see that I'm the one
            Who understands you
            Been here all along
            So, why can't you see?
            You belong with me
            You belong with me
            Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
            I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
            Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
            Hey, isn't this easy?
            And you've got a smile
            That can light up this whole town
            I haven't seen it in a while
            Since she brought you down
            You say you're fine, I know you better than that
            Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?
            She wears high heels
            I wear sneakers
            She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
            Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
            That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
            If you could see that I'm the one
            Who understands you
            Been here all along
            So, why can't you see?
            You belong with me
            Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
            All this time how could you not know, baby?
            You belong with me
            You belong with me
            Oh, I remember you driving to my house
            In the middle of the night
            I'm the one who makes you laugh
            When you know you're 'bout to cry
            And I know your favorite songs
            And you tell me 'bout your dreams
            Think I know where you belong
            Think I know it's with me
            Can't you see that I'm the one
            Who understands you?
            Been here all along
            So, why can't you see?
            You belong with me
            Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
            All this time how could you not know, baby?
            You belong with me
            You belong with me
            You belong with me
            Have you ever thought just maybe
            You belong with me?
            You belong with me

        <h3>I Knew You Were Trouble</h3>
        <pre class="lyrics">
            Once upon a time
            A few mistakes ago
            I was in your sights
            You got me alone
            You found me
            You found me
            You found me
            I guess you didn't care
            And I guess I liked that
            And when I fell hard
            You took a step back
            Without me
            Without me
            Without me
            And he's long gone
            When he's next to me
            And I realize
            The blame is on me
            'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
            So shame on me now
            Flew me to places I'd never been
            'Til you put me down, oh
            I knew you were trouble when you walked in
            So, shame on me now
            Flew me to places I'd never been
            Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
            Oh, oh
            Trouble, trouble, trouble
            Oh, oh
            Trouble, trouble, trouble
            No apologies
            He'll never see you cry
            Pretends he doesn't know
            That he's the reason why
            You're drowning
            You're drowning
            You're drowning
            And I heard you moved on
            From whispers on the street
            A new notch in your belt
            Is all I'll ever be
            And now I see
            Now I see
            Now I see
            He was long gone
            When he met me
            And I realize
            The joke is on me, hey
            I knew you were trouble when you walked in (oh)
            So shame on me now
            Flew me to places I'd never been
            'Til you put me down, oh
            I knew you were trouble when you walked in
            So shame on me now
            Flew me to places I'd never been, yeah
            Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
            Oh, oh (yeah)
            Trouble, trouble, trouble
            Oh, oh
            Trouble, trouble, trouble
            And the saddest fear
            Comes creepin' in
            That you never loved me
            Or her
            Or anyone
            Or anything
            Yeah
            I knew you were trouble when you walked in
            So shame on me now
            Flew me to places I'd never been (never been)
            'Til you put me down, oh
            I knew you were trouble when you walked in (knew it right there)
            So shame on me now (knew it right there)
            Flew me to places I'd never been
            (Ooh) now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
            Oh, oh
            Trouble, trouble, trouble (oh)
            Oh, oh
            Trouble, trouble, trouble
            I knew you were trouble when you walked in
            Trouble, trouble, trouble
            I knew you were trouble when you walked in
            Trouble, trouble, trouble
